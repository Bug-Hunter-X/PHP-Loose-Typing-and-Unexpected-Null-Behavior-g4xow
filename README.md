# PHP Loose Typing and Unexpected Null Behavior

This repository demonstrates a common error in PHP related to loose typing and null values.  The `bug.php` file contains a function that attempts to handle null values, but due to PHP's loose typing, there might be edge cases or unexpected behavior.

The `bugSolution.php` file provides a potential solution that addresses the issue more explicitly and robustly.
